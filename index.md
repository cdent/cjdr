I am an experienced developer, team leader and thinker with a passion
for maximizing access to information that empowers individuals and
groups to get things done. I'm a vocal advocate of the open web, open
protocols and open source. I make tools that allow people to create,
share and synthesize information on the web so they can learn and
collaborate.

Projects
--------

_A sampling. See [GitHub](https://github.com/cdent) for more._

### [Gabbi](https://github.com/cdent/gabbi) <https://gabbi.readthedocs.org>
_2014 - Present_

Declarative HTTP testing.

Creator of a tool for running tests of HTTP APIs where requests and
responses are represented in a declarative YAML-based form.

### [TiddlyWeb](https://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlyweb) <http://tiddlyweb.com>
_2008 - Present_

The canonical HTTP API for tiddlers: small chunks of content on the web.

Project originator, lead and community manager for a WSGI-based Python
application originally created as a reference server side for
TiddlyWiki; TiddlyWeb has since evolved into a robust generic content and
data store with a pluggable architecture allowing multiple representations
and storage systems.

### [TiddlySpace](https://github.com/TiddlySpace/tiddlyspace) <http://tiddlyspace.com>
_2010 - 2013_

A discoursive social model for tiddlers.

Lead developer and architect, project lead, community manager and administrator
of the major installation at <http://tiddlyspace.com>. TiddlySpace is an
application of TiddlyWeb enhanced to operate at scale with a large number
of users and a simplified user experience. A fairly complex melange of
Python and JavaScript (in the client and server).

### [PurpleWiki](http://search.cpan.org/~cdent/PurpleWiki-0.94/)
_2003 - 2004_

A derivation of the Perl-based UseMod wiki implementing
[Purple Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Numbers)

of content between wiki pages and other systems.

Education
---------

### Master Information Science, Indiana University
_2001 - 2002_

Effectively interspersed a course in HCI and information
representation and retrieval with a general overview of computer
science. Of special note:

* [The Computer As Tool](http://peermore.com/astool.html), a paper exploring
  task and tool orientation in human computer interaction.
* A Java Software Engineering course which began with a review of design
  patterns and ended with a [grueling refactoring of the KnownSpace
  kernel](http://www.burningchrome.com/~cdent/649/ass5/turnin/refactorings.htm)
  and the implementation of the [Helium UI](http://helium.knownspace.org/)
  over the kernel.


Writing
-------

### [Inverting the Social Web with Internet Banks of Content](http://iboc.tiddlyspace.com/)
_2011_

The fundamental concept in an Internet Bank of Content (IBOC) is that
rather than giving a piece of sociable content to a web service, a
participant in the social web would upload or locate that content in
their Bank and provide a URI to the service, called a presentation
service. The bank holds the content in trust for the individual.

### [TiddlyWeb: HTTP for Tiddlers](http://peermore.com/http_tiddlers.pdf)
_2010_

Describes the lessons learned while developing TiddlyWeb as a resource
oriented HTTP API.

### [The Computer as Tool: From Interaction To Augmentation](http://peermore.com/astool.html)
_2002_

Describes a design approach wherein computers and computer applications
are thought of as tools rather than interactive devices. This paper was
instrumental in forming the
[Blue Oxen Way](http://eekim.com/blog/2007/02/the-blue-oxen-way/),
a framework for a philsophy of collaboration.

### [Creating Conceptual Access: Faceted Knowledge Organization in the unrev-ii email archives](http://burningchrome.com/~cdent/uviz/portpaper2.html)
_2002_

The email archive of the unrev-ii list is the basis for this ongoing
project, to build an access tool for an email archive that also
functions as a knowledge repository.

### [Hypertext and Knowledge Enhancement](http://www.burningchrome.com/~cdent/sliswarp/)
_2001_

A fun and rambling exploration of hypertext and knowledge enhancement
driven by a hypertext tool specially created for the project.
