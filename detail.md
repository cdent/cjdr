==========

My goal is to create environments where shared learning and synthesis
are as effective as possible. The environments combine technology,
process and culture in a way that encourages the free exchange of
information. That exchange empowers people. If the exchange happens in a
way that allows the information to persist then people who are distant in
time or space can participate and contribute as well.

I believe the best way to accomplish this goal is to partner with groups
to help them solve their information problems. Often the problems are a
result of lack of tooling, but sometimes they come from unhealthy processes.
The best way to solve either class of problem is to actively participate
in the group, sharing in whatever it is they do, with an eye to understanding
and improving tooling and process and incrementally making steady improvements.
